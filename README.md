# DDST-NeRF
Dynamic Space-Time Decoupling Neural Radiance Field (DDST-NeRF) method. By modeling static and dynamic scenes separately and integrating spatio-temporal modeling with dynamic weighting fusion, DDST-NeRF enables the generation of novel views and perspectives at any time from monocular videos.
